Hi. Today was one of those days that felt like a balancing act. I had a pretty full day of classes and managed to stay focused for most of it, but I kept catching myself thinking about HackUMass coming up. The idea of working on an AI/ML project that could be really innovative is exciting, but also a little daunting. I want to make sure I have a strong concept that can actually make an impact. In between classes, I worked on my application for the UCA position in CICS 110. I feel like I’m starting to get a clearer picture of what they’re looking for, and I tried to emphasize my background with teaching and leadership roles in high school. I really want to show how my experience could help make the course more accessible for other students. Later in the day, I finally allowed myself some downtime, and it felt like a huge relief. I’ve been pushing myself pretty hard, and it was nice to just sit back for a while without feeling like I had to do something productive. Overall, today felt productive but a bit intense. I’m hoping tomorrow I can find a better balance between working hard and recharging. Thank you.
