I Oh This blade has a dark past in a shed much innocent blood. You're a fool for traveling alone so completely unprepared. You're lucky your blood's still flowing. Thank you. So what brings you to the land of the gatekeepers? I'm searching for someone. Someone very dear. A kindred spirit. A dragon. A dangerous quest for a lone hunter. I've been alone for as long as I can remember. Hey! From my stomach. Hey, sit still. Good night's kiss. I'm going to be a little bit more careful. I'm going to be a little bit more careful. Get him, skills! Come on! Get him! Get him! Get him! Skills! Yeah! Come on! Woo! Yeah! Come on! Woo! Woo! Yeah! Come on! Woo! Woo! Woo! I just sprinted pulling down. Miguel... Let's go! I have failed. You've only failed to see. These are dragon lands, Sintel. You are closer than you know. I have failed. Scales! Scales! Scales! My man! Scales! Scales? Scales? Scales? Scales? Scales? Scales? Come take my journey into light. Come be my shadow. Walk at my side. And when you see. All that I have seen. Can you tell me now from behind? I have been waiting all this time. For one to wake me. One to call mine. So when you're here. All that you hold dear. Do you fear what you will find? This path breaks through the night. I'm a home forever long. And for the home. I've found in your eyes. I will give this name for the drum. To call me over. Far away from my tender youth. And the very truth. Showing me what I've begun. This is how it breaks through the night. I've a home forever long. And for the home. I've found in your eyes. Your voice so is through the night.
